Intent: Open or update a pull request with a consistent narrative.

**When to use which base/head**

| Goal | Base | Head | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Land daily work | `develop` | your `feat/*` / `fix/*` branch | After **`/Ship`** pushed the branch. |
| Update production / public site | `main` | `develop` | When you are ready to deploy what is on `develop` (often after **`/Ship`** work is merged into `develop`). |

**ViZb workflow (see `docs/development/BRANCHING.md`):**

1. **Feature integration:** **`<feature-branch>` → `develop`** (daily work).
2. **Release:** **`develop` → `main`** (when promoting to production).

**Merge style:** **Create a merge commit** for both feature→`develop` and release `develop`→`main`. Do **not** squash-merge into **`main`** (breaks the release boundary). Use `gh pr merge --merge`. Squash is **not** the default for agents; see `docs/development/BRANCHING.md`.

Prompt text:

Create or update a PR as appropriate.

IMPORTANT:

- Check for an **open PR** with the same head/base before creating a duplicate.
- If `gh pr edit` fails (GraphQL / project metadata), fall back to `gh api` REST PATCH.
- Describe the **full** branch delta honestly — not “this session only” unless true.

Title format: `fix(<area>): <short outcome>` (or feat/docs/chore as fit)
