/ship

Intent: Summarize the session, run checks, update docs, stage intended files only, commit, push **the current branch** (integration happens via PR into **`develop`**).

Prompt text:

Summarize problems fixed / discovered this session (bullets).

**Project skill (this repo):** For Marching 2 More, align ships and CTAs with **`.cursor/skills/marching-2-more/SKILL.md`** and **`lib/m2m-site.ts`**. Commands index: **`.cursor/commands/README.md`**.

IMPORTANT OPERATING RULES:

- Inspect the working tree; separate **intended** changes from unrelated edits. Do not commit unrelated files.
- **PowerShell:** do not use `&&` as a separator; use `;` or separate invocations.
- Before commit, ensure `git config user.name` and `user.email` are set. Do **not** change git config automatically.
- If a hook fails, fix and make a normal commit; do not amend unless asked.

**Branching (ViZb):** See `docs/development/BRANCHING.md`. Prefer a **feature branch** (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, etc.) off **`develop`**, not long-running commits only on **`develop`**.

- If the current branch is **`develop`**: pushing is allowed only for **small agreed exceptions** (e.g. docs-only). For normal product work, **create a branch first**, commit there, then push the feature branch and open a PR to **`develop`**.
- If the current branch is **not** `develop`: after commit, **`git push -u origin <current-branch>`** (or push without `-u` if tracking exists). Tell the user to open/update a PR: **`gh pr create --base develop --head <branch>`** (or merge via GitHub UI).

Run mandatory checks (stop on failure):

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

Documentation updates (in order):

1. **`docs/MVP_STATUS_ROADMAP.md`** — what moved forward / what’s next (P0/P1) if behavior or phase changed.
2. **`docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`** or subtree READMEs if you added new doc areas.
3. **`docs/troubleshooting/COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** — if you fixed a repeatable failure mode, add a row.

Then:

- `git status` — list files for this ship vs leave untouched.
- Stage **only** intended paths.
- `git log -5 --oneline` — match commit message style.
- Commit message format: `fix(<area>): <short outcome>` or `feat(<area>): …` / `docs: …` as appropriate. Pass the message safely for PowerShell (no bash heredoc).
- Push **the branch you are on** (`git push` / `git push -u origin <branch>`), not necessarily `develop`.

Return:

- Bullets: fixed / discovered  
- Checks + outcomes  
- Docs touched  
- Files committed  
- Branch name + push result  
- Commit SHA  
- Next step: PR link or `gh pr create …` if appropriate  
- Unrelated files left unstaged
